I built the most annoying cookie popup ;)

I used various methods to make it impossible to close the popup window without the user typing in his/her name and the email adress.

In this project among other I used and learned more about :
- setTimeout()
- event.prevenDefault()
- formData & .get()
- the disabled attribute
